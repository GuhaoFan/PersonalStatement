### Motivation

I have been working as a [{job title}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-queeny-qin-5b6b199a/) in [{company names}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-queeny-qin-5b6b199a/) for 2 years. The key that motivates me to apply for [{school program name}](https://harrisburgu.edu/) is that accountants are extremely busy during tax season (from Janurary to April), I want to learn computer programming skills to improve this.

Looking back my experience, we are doing heavy amount of manual work which is clearly automateble. Every year during tax season, more than 20% of time wasted on manual operations like `some examples`. I found everytime there are certain patterns to do the job. In short term, if I let a computer program doing it, I can save those `20%` time to either create more value for my company or have better work life balance. For long term goal, I want to eventually use computer program to help reduce overall work load and improve work life balance during tax season for all accountants. An accountant of `CPA comapny` works at lease 80 hours during tax season, and this is becoming a major barrier that fewer people want to choose this career.

### Reason for Suitable

As for computer programming, I'm already getting familiar with it since `example that having similar classes in undergraduate school`. The programming language is also tend to be more human friendly, like python, I can write a program that looks like English `mabye an example`. I believe with my experience for previous course and the understanding of modern programming language, I will be able to learn how to write a production level computer program and finally use it to improve accountants work.
